# Tic-Tac-Drone
A student project for Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb

The goal of the project is to develop a system that allows two miniature quadcopters to autonomously play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other.
We are using H8 mini quadcopters, OptiTrack and ROS.
